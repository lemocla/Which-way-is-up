                <p>Peter Charalambides is a visual artist living and working in London, England.</p>
                <p>Peter works in a variety of mediums including spray and acrylic paint, oil sticks, collage and pen.
                    Pieces are characterised by colour and texture- qualities that magnify an expressionist style
                    throughout his works. There is a defining dichotomy in Peter's work, in so much that he seesaws
                    wildly between the monochrome and precision, to the free and colourful.</p>
                <p>Peter is currently working on a series exploring the ideas of choice and freedom. Are choices freely
                    made or are they influenced by previous decisions (such as what childrenâ€™s television programmes we
                    watched as children)? Or perhaps, we have no choice (or freedom whatsoever) and our paths are mapped
                    from the very outset.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the pieces attempt to explore the ideas of existentialism, determinism and fatalism
                    through the medium of imagery, words and mathematics.</p>
                <p>Peter Charalambides is a working artist and has sold artworks to patrons around the world. His work
                    has appeared in numerous exhibitions in the U.K and appeared in several publications.</p>
                <p class='mb-1'>Peter has also donated several of his drawings to local causes, which have subsequently been used in
                    merchandising and other charitable fund raising activities.</p>
